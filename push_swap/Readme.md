# push_swap

## Push_swap is a project about efficiently sorting a list of numbers with some constraints.

### We have two stacks and the following commands at our disposal:
- #### pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b
- #### pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a
- #### sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a
- #### sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b
- #### ss : sa and sb at the same time
- #### ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one
- #### rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one
- #### rr : ra and rb at the same time
- #### rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one
- #### rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one
- #### rrr : rra and rrb at the same time

### The project
- #### ðŸ“¶ "push_swap" executable will accept the numbers as arguments and will display the necessary commands to sort them.
